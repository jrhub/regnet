# regnet

Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable selections for 
    high-dimensional biological data, due to its ability to incorporate the correlations 
    among genomic features.This package provides procedures for fitting network-based regularization, 
    minimax concave penalty (MCP) and lasso penalty for generalized linear models. This current 
    version, regnet0.1.1, focuses on binary outcomes. Functions for continuous, survival outcomes 
    and other regularization methods will be included in the forthcoming upgraded version.
	
## How to install
Run these two lines of code in R
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jrhub/regnet")
```
## Examples

###Example.1 (CV.NetLogistic)
```
result = CV.NetLogistic(regnet$X, regnet$Y, r = 4.5)  
result$lambda  
b = NetLogistic(regnet$X, regnet$Y, result$lambda[1,1], result$lambda[1,2])  
index = which(regnet$beta != 0)  
pos = which(b != 0)  
tp = length(intersect(index, pos))  
fp = length(pos) - tp  
list(tp=tp, fp=fp)  
```

###Example.2 (CV.McpLogistic)
```
result = CV.McpLogistic(regnet$X, regnet$Y, r = 4.5)  
result$lambda  
b = McpLogistic(regnet$X, regnet$Y, result$lambda[1])  
index = which(regnet$beta != 0)  
pos = which(b != 0)  
tp = length(intersect(index, pos))  
fp = length(pos) - tp  
list(tp=tp, fp=fp)  
```
