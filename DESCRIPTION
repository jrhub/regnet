Description: Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable selections for 
  high-dimensional biological data, due to its ability to incorporate the correlations 
  among genomic features.This package provides procedures for fitting network-based regularization,
	minimax concave penalty (MCP) and lasso penalty for generalized linear models. This first
	version, regent0.1.0, focuses on binary outcomes. Functions for continuous, survival outcomes 
	and other regularization methods will be included in the forthcoming upgraded version.
