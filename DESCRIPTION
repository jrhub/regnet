Description: Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable selection for 
    high-dimensional biological data due to its ability to incorporate correlations among 
    genomic features. This package provides procedures of network-based variable selection 
    for generalized linear models (Ren et al. (2017) <doi:10.1186/s12863-017-0495-5> and 
	Ren et al.(2019) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22194>). Continuous, binary, and survival response 
	are supported. Robust network-based methods are available for continuous and survival 
	responses.
